# Photo-Bio-Reactor-for-green-hydrogen-production
Hydrogen production through photo-bioreactor systems offers a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation, utilizing phototrophic microorganisms to convert wastewater into green hydrogen. Our pipeline aims to design and optimize such a system targeting a production capacity of 0.5-1 kg/day of green hydrogen.
